These are some exercises from the [Digital Design and Computer Architecture, RISC-V Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Design-Computer-Architecture-RISC-V/dp/0128200642/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1Q071MFJGNW3G&keywords=digital+design+and+computer+architecture&qid=1641947814&sprefix=digital+design+%2Caps%2C175&sr=8-3) book by Harris and Harris. I tested them on the free lite version of [ModelSim-Intel FPGA Edition](https://fpgasoftware.intel.com/20.1.1/?edition=lite&platform=linux&product=modelsim_ae#tabs-2). 

To run them, from ModelSim, open each directory, then run `Simulate` from the menu. Select the `testbench` in teach project. From ModelSim built-in terminal, run something like:

`run 100`

To restart, run:

`restart -force`
